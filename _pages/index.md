Hello! I'm **Dr. Wasikul Islam**, an Experimental Particle Physicist currently affiliated with the **University of Wisconsin–Madison(USA)**, as a Scientist. I also work as a Physicist at the ATLAS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider(LHC), **CERN, Switzerland**. I am a Visiting Research Affiliate at **SLAC National Lab, Stanford University (USA)**.

My research aims to uncover new physics at the Large Hadron Collider and the future particle physics experiments by developing cutting‑edge techniques and algorithms for high‑energy physics, powered by AI and machine learning. My passion for particle physics is driven by a profound desire to understand our universe at its most fundamental and smallest scales.

My recent honors include the **Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics-2025** (shared with ATLAS/CERN colleagues), **Wisconsin Initiative for Science Literacy Award (2024)**, **Postdoc Excellence Award (2023)**, and election to **Sigma Xi Scientific Research Honor Society (2025)**. I'm an author of **600+ physics papers** and two books (One related to **physics**, and the other a **Bangla poetry** collection).

My journey spans:
- Ph.D. in Physics from Oklahoma State University, USA (2021)  
- Research fellowships and past positions at **CERN**, **Argonne National Lab**, **Fermilab**, and the **University of Wisconsin-Madiosn**.  
- B.Sc. & M.Sc. in Physics from Aligarh Muslim University, India.

## My Research

As an experimental particle physicist, I do my research to understand the world of Physics at the most fundamental level in terms of the particles, which are the building blocks of our universe. I conduct various searches for New Physics using the data collected by the ATLAS detector at CERN and I also do measurements of physics processes, hardware studies, and algorithm developments for our ATLAS experiment. I also pursue some phenomenological studies based on personal interest.

## Completed Searches / Physics Projects at ATLAS

### 1. **Search for New Physics using Event-based Anomaly Detection**
- **Paper**: [PhysRevLett.132.081801](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01612)  
We searched for new physics in the form of anomalous events using a novel anomaly detection technique based on unsupervised machine learning. This was the **first event-based anomaly detection** search of ATLAS/CERN, and showed significant improvement in sensitivity across 9 different BSM channels.

### 2. **Enhancing Di-Higgs Boson search sensitivities with ML**
- **Paper**: [arXiv:2504.12418](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12418)  
Developed machine learning techniques to enhance sensitivity for di-Higgs boson searches, using both anomaly detection and supervised classifiers in multiple final states.

### 3. **ADFilter: Web Tool for Anomaly Detection**
- **Paper**: [arXiv:2409.03065](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03065)  
Co-developed the **ADFilter** web tool to reinterpret BSM models using anomaly detection with trained autoencoders from ATLAS data.

### 4. **WIPUNet: Pileup-Resistant Image Denoising**
- **Paper**: [arXiv:2509.05662](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05662)  
Developed **WIPUNet**, a physics-inspired neural network for image denoising. The network embeds pileup-mitigation principles to increase robustness against noise. Applications are underway in jet images and calorimeter data.

### 5. **Search for Vector Boson Resonances (W′ → tb)**
- **Paper**: [JHEP12(2023)073](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08521)  
Searched for left- and right-handed **W′ bosons** via their decay into top and bottom quarks, in both hadronic and leptonic channels. Mass limits up to **4.6 TeV** were established.

### 6. **Multi-body Invariant Mass Searches**
- **Paper**: [JHEP07(2023)202](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08945)  
Searches for new physics in **3-body and 4-body** invariant masses in isolated lepton events, using √s = 13 TeV pp collisions in ATLAS data.

### 7. **Phenomenological Studies on Multi-body Invariants**
- **Papers**:
  - [Universe 2021, 7(9), 333](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1997/7/9/333), [arXiv:2209.13128](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13128), [arXiv:2210.02591](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02591)  
These model-independent proposals contributed to **Snowmass 2021** topical reports on BSM physics and collider theory.

### 8. **Charged Higgs Search (dijet + lepton channel)**
- **Paper**: [JHEP 06 (2020) 151](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06465)  
Searched for singly charged Higgs bosons through the **dijet + lepton** channel. The analysis also probed **Z′**, **dark matter**, and various BSM scenarios.

### 9. **W′ Search in All-Hadronic Decay**
- **Paper**: [ATLAS-CONF-2021-043](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2788160)  
Used full Run 2 ATLAS data to search for **W′ → tb** in all-hadronic channels. Results are presented as exclusion limits on mass vs coupling.

### 10. **b-Jet Identification Algorithm: Direct Tag**
Developed a new **mistag calibration method** named **Direct Tag** with advisor Prof. Alexander Khanov during PhD, improving performance of b-jet identification in heavy flavor enriched samples.
